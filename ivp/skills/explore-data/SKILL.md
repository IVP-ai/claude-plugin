description: Answer a business question from the user's IVP.ai datasets by finding the right dataset, checking its columns, aggregating and explaining the result. Use for questions about totals, trends, rankings or rows in the user's IVP.ai data.
---

Use the IVP.ai tools to answer questions about the user's data ("what were sales by region last quarter?", "who are our top customers?").

0. **Use agreed metrics when they exist.** If the question is about a data room, or `describe_dataset` shows the dataset is in one, call `get_semantic_layer` for that data room. When the metric the user asks about is defined there, answer with `query_metrics` (metrics, dimensions with a time `grain`, filters, `order_by`) instead of `aggregate_dataset`, and say the figure uses the data room's agreed definition. Otherwise continue below.
1. **Find the dataset.** Call `list_datasets` (use `search` with a key noun from the question). If several look plausible, pick the best match by name and mention which one you used; ask the user only if it is genuinely ambiguous.
2. **Check the columns.** Call `describe_dataset` before querying. Map the user's words to real columns (match on display names). Note which columns are `number` (needed for sum/avg) and `timestamp` (needed for date bucketing).
3. **Compute, don't page.** Use `aggregate_dataset` for totals, counts, averages, trends and rankings:
   - Trends: `group_by` the timestamp column with a `granularity` (month by default) and sort ascending by it.
   - Rankings: `group_by` the entity, add the metric, `sort` by the metric descending, `limit` to the top N.
   - Time windows: use a `last_n_days` filter or `gte`/`lt` on the timestamp column.
   Use `preview_dataset` only when the user wants to see example rows.
4. **Answer.** Lead with the direct answer, then a compact table of the key rows. State the dataset, filters and any assumptions (e.g. "month = calendar month of Created"). If `truncated` is true, say the result was capped.

Never invent numbers: only report values returned by the tools. If a column the question needs doesn't exist, say so and suggest the closest available one.
